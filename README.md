# 🌦 Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Accurate rainfall prediction is **critical** for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster prevention.  
Traditional methods rely on meteorological models, which are often **computationally intensive** and may fail to capture complex nonlinear relationships in weather data.  

To address this, we propose a **machine learning-based predictive model** that leverages **historical weather data** to predict the likelihood of rainfall for the next day.

## 🔍 System Approach
Our approach involves a **data-driven pipeline** that combines data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to produce accurate rainfall predictions.  

### ✅ Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection & Loading**
   - Utilized a historical weather dataset containing features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
   - Loaded the dataset using **Pandas** for data manipulation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked for **missing values** and handled them appropriately.
   - Analyzed feature distributions and relationships using **visualizations**.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values using **imputation techniques**.
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical format using **Label Encoding**.
   - Scaled features using **StandardScaler** for better model performance.

4. **Feature Selection**
   - Selected key meteorological features that strongly influence rainfall.

5. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** as the primary model for binary classification (Rain vs. No Rain).
   - Split the dataset into **training and testing sets** to ensure generalization.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used **accuracy score**, **confusion matrix**, and **classification report** to assess performance.
   - Fine-tuned the model for better predictive accuracy.

7. **Prediction**
   - Predicted the **probability of rainfall** for the next day based on test data.
